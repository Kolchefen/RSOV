# RSOV
This is a capstone project aimed at creating a platform for Univserity of Oklahoma attendants to easily ride share within the community, incentivized by rewards and competition.

---

# Project Description
In this project we need to have 4 core components in order to facility safe, verified, and easy-to-use ride sharing. For saftely we need to implement a student/faculty/staff verification system, initially we will focus on students. Then we need to have proximity verification to ensure individuals are actually carpooling. Next we need a GPS/destination system to coordinate pick-ups and drop-offs. The forth component is the rewards system, to incentivize ride sharing and balence the driver-to-rider ratio. 

These core components require us to create a mobile application in order to satify mobile nature of the application. 

# Technologies and Tools
We will be using the following technologies in order to facilitate the mobile applciaiton and to mitigate hardware resstritions we will be utilizing a service and SDK called (Expo)[https://docs.expo.dev/]. This allows us to make iOS and Andriod applications simultaneously, and we can test our application with the Expo Go app, that can host work-in-progress builds without a developer liscense. 

Expo is built upon React Native under the hood, so in addition to all the resources available from the Expo documentation, we also have access to tutorials and documentation associated with React Native, which is maintained and updated by Meta.

The main coding languages being used will be TSX (TypeScript-XML), JSON, HTML, and CSS. TSX will contain the main business logic, and define the structure of the application, TSX allows the syndication of HTML and XML language within the script to streamline component creation and reusablility.

JSON will be responsible for sending and recieving messages and API calls over the network or between services.

HTML will be used to define the structure of the app, mostly within TSX and components therein.

CSS will be used in some cases to generalize the style and appearance of the app.

# Project Plan and Timeline

This project will consist of 4 main sprints (Dates specified are end-dates of sprints):

- Sprint 1: Establish project goals, initial setup, and client communication. (Feb 5, 2026)
- Sprint 2: Familiarize and onboard the team with the skills needed to produce the application. Also create the first prototypes of the application. (March 1, 2026)
- Sprint 3: Communicate findings and developments with client, adjust trajectory at this point to meet deadlines and functional requirements, redefine scope if necessary. (April 1, 2026)
- Sprint 4: Conduct Alpha and Beta testing to provide Proof of Concept of the application for the Client, and pursue further improvements outside of Capstone to create a functional, maintainable, and self sufficient application. (April 30, 2026)

# Documentation and Task Assignment
GitHub will act as the main source of documentation and artifacting. Using GitHub's Issue Board, Kanban, and Wiki systems will be used to document features, components, bugs, and fixes. The most important aspect of the documentation will be recording why code was written and what its purpose is. 

Team members are expected to be proactive, while reciving a large amount of direction from the Sprint Master to identify and begin work on a feature or issue.

The main flow of documentation will be as follows:
 1. Identify and document the proposed requirement and record it under an intention revealing name on the wiki, putting all related sub-components beneath the topic. 
 2. Create an issue on the Issue Board then create a merge request, documenting its purpose and challenges.
 3. Once the issue is complete, update the wiki with pertinent information about its limitations, conditions for functionality, and how it affects the rest of the application.
