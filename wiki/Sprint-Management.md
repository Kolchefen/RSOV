# Sprint Management

This document outlines the sprint structure, goals, and tracking for the RSOV (Reduce Single-Occupancy Vehicles) capstone project.

---

## Overview

The project is organized into **4 sprints**, each with defined goals and deliverables. The Sprint Master provides direction, and team members are expected to be proactive in identifying and completing work.

### Sprint Review Meetings

A **Sprint Review is held every Monday**. During each review the team will:

- Review old tickets and assess their current status
- Define new tickets based on emerging requirements and priorities

| Sprint   | Start Date     | End Date       | Focus Area                          |
|----------|---------------|----------------|--------------------------------------|
| Sprint 1 | Jan 2026      | Feb 5, 2026    | Project goals, setup, and client communication |
| Sprint 2 | Feb 6, 2026   | March 1, 2026  | Onboarding, skill development, and first prototypes |
| Sprint 3 | March 2, 2026 | April 1, 2026  | Client feedback, scope adjustment    |
| Sprint 4 | April 2, 2026 | April 30, 2026 | Testing and proof of concept         |

## Documentation Workflow

Each sprint follows this documentation process (as defined in the project plan):

1. **Identify and document** the proposed requirement under an intention-revealing name on the wiki, with all related sub-components beneath the topic.
2. **Create an issue** on the Issue Board, then create a merge request documenting its purpose and challenges.
3. **Update the wiki** once the issue is complete, recording pertinent information about its limitations, conditions for functionality, and how it affects the rest of the application.

## Roles and Responsibilities

| Role            | Responsibility                                                                 |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Sprint Master   | Provides direction, identifies priorities, and tracks sprint progress          |
| Team Members    | Proactively pick up tasks, develop features, and document work                |

## How to Use This Document

- Update the **deliverable checklists** as items are completed during each sprint.
- Fill in the **Retrospective** section at the end of each sprint with lessons learned, what went well, and what can be improved.
- Link related GitHub Issues and merge requests in the deliverable items for traceability.
